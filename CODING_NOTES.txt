Project: D&D 5e Loot Generator (Tkinter)

Main file: loot_gui.py
- Tkinter GUI for generating SRD-style treasure (individual or hoard) with coins, gems/art, magic items, and clipboard copy.
- Individual treasure now always includes a CR-scaled magic item (toggleable checkbox).
- Hoard tables and individual tables are embedded.
- Spell scrolls expand to real spell names using a local spell list (no network).

Custom items & persistence:
- GUI supports global extra items (one per line) appended to all tables.
- Scoped additions: specify item, target table (A–I or ALL), and CR band (Any, 0-4, 5-10, 11-16, 17+). Added items are auto-saved.
- JSON load/save: path in the JSON entry (default custom_items.json). Auto-loads on startup. Saves include:
  - Per-table lists (keys A–I)
  - GLOBAL (list)
  - CR_SCOPED (list of {range:[low, high], item})
- Manual “Save custom items to JSON” button also available.

Spell scrolls:
- Local DEFAULT_SPELLS per level. Spell scroll items like “Spell scroll (5th level)” become “Spell scroll (level 5): <random spell>”.

Error handling:
- Generate is wrapped in try/except to prevent GUI crashes; errors shown in the output box.

Repository state:
- A .gitignore was added to exclude venv, caches, downloaded HTML/JS/PDF/json artifacts, and cloned data repos.
- Committed files: loot_gui.py and .gitignore on branch main (local commit). Push is pending because GitHub requires PAT/SSH.

Next steps to push:
- Use PAT or SSH. For HTTPS: `git remote set-url origin https://<USER>:<PAT>@github.com/neepster/dnd5eloot.git` then `git push origin main`.
- For SSH: add your SSH key to GitHub, set remote to `git@github.com:neepster/dnd5eloot.git`, then push.

How to run:
- `python loot_gui.py`
- Add enemies (CR, count, hoard?). Optionally load custom_items.json. Enter global extras or scoped items. Click Generate Loot. Copy via button.

Current defaults/notes:
- Custom items saved automatically when using the scoped “Add” control.
- Bulk extras under the labeled text area have a hint about formatting.
- No network dependency (spells are local).
